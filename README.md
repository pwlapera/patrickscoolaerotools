patrickscoolaerotools is a set of tools designed to help people create video game aircraft in which behave in plausible and satisfying ways.

IMPORTANT WARNING DISCLAIMER: Pilots should not under any circumstances use patrickscoolaerotools to set their altimeter or do any sort of calculaton related to the operation of an aircraft or any other sort of vehicle. patrickscoolaerotools does NOT use the FAA formulas for atmospheric density and therefore is almost certain to result in an incorrect altimeter setting. patrickscoolaerotools is a tool to help people create plausible behaviors in video games, not to predict real-world phenomenon.

The goal of patrickscoolaerotools is not total accuracy but rather approximate answers which can be used to create plausible behaviors.

patrickscoolaerotools currently a work in progress with very limited functionality made by someone who is still learning to code, but both are improving every day.

Current features: It can currently to tell you the air density for a given altitude based on the ground temperature and barometer reading. Its calculations are currently based on 1976 US standard atmosphere model. You can also calculate the lift of a theoretical wing at a given speed and compare it to a Cessna 172.

The long term goal for patrickscoolaerotools is to become something game devs can plug into popular game engines to make their aircraft behave plausibly.

October 26 update: -Fixed a bug which caused the temperature to be thousands of degrees C in the upper atmosphere -The program no longer displays calculation for your wing and the Cessna wing comparison on the same command line

Planned features:

Answers that are less flagrantly wrong (low priority)
I will learn what a class is in the context of C++ and implement it in my program
I will learn what an array is and implement it (unlikely)
A function which will tell you if your craft will have generate enough lift to stay airborne at a given weight, speed, and altitude
Density calculations that can incorporate humidity
Density calculations from any ground level, not just sea level
The ability to create your own atmospheres for custom planets
Headwind and tailwind calculations
Drag calculations
The ability to compare the performance of your wing to the performance of the type of aircraft you're trying to create
